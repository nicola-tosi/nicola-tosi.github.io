I am a planetary physicist at the [Institute of Planetary Research](https://www.dlr.de/pf/en/) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin. My research focuses on understanding the interior structure and the thermal and compositional evolution of rocky bodies of the solar system and of low-mass extrasolar planets, including feedbacks between interior, surface and atmosphere. To this end, I use a variety of numerical models — from simple 1D to large-scale 3D — to simulate the dynamics and evolution of planetary interiors and interpret observations made by space missions. I am also interested in applying machine learning techniques in the frame of surrogate forward modelling of interior dynamics as well as of inverse modelling of planetary interior structure and dynamics to rapidly infer model parameters from observations.
