I am a planetary physicist at the [Institute of Planetary Research](https://www.dlr.de/pf/en/) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin. My research focuses on understanding the interior structure and the thermal and compositional evolution of rocky bodies of the solar system and of low-mass extrasolar planets, including feedbacks between interior, surface and atmosphere. To this end, I use a variety of numerical models — from simple 1D to large-scale 3D — to simulate the dynamics and evolution of planetary interiors and interpret geological and geophysical observations made by space missions. Recently, I became interested in applying machine learning techniques in the frame of surrogate forward modelling of interior dynamics as well as of inverse modelling to rapidly infer model parameters from surface observations.

<span style="color:steelblue"> I have an opening for a fully funded **3-years postdoc position** in a new
project named PLAGeS (Physics-based Learning Algorithms for Geophysical fluid Simulations). We aim at extending a
purely data-driven approach for surrogate modelling of planetary interior dynamics to the rapidly growing field of
*physics-based machine learning*. The goal of the project is the development of a fast, machine-learning-based solver
for thermal convection and its application to the modelling of the interior evolution of rocky bodies, with a
particular focus on Mercury, Mars, and rocky exoplanets. Applications must be submitted through the DLR job portal
at [this address](https://www.dlr.de/dlr/jobs/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10596/1003_read-49930/) and include a
motivation letter summarizing research interests, academic transcripts from relevant degrees, CV, and names and
contact information of at least two references. For more information, you can contact me via
[email](mailto:nicola.tosi@dlr.de).</span>
