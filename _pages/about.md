I am a planetary physicist at the [Institute of Planetary Research](https://www.dlr.de/pf/en/) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin. I am interested in the interior structure and evolution of terrestrial bodies of the solar and extrasolar systems. I use numerical models of convection — from simple 1D to large-scale 3D models — to simulate the dynamics and evolution of planetary interiors and interpret geological and geophysical observations made by spacecraft missions.
